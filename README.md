# Laravel Demo Project

**testCodeGram** is a social media web application built with Laravel as part of my learning journey.  
The app replicates key Instagram features such as user authentication, posting photos, following users, and interacting through likes and comments.  

This project helped me strengthen my knowledge of the Laravel MVC framework, database design, authentication, and AWS deployment.
